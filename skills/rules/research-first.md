# Research First Principle

## Core Rule

Never make assumptions without verification.

## Guidelines

1. **Verify before acting** - Check existing code/config before making changes
2. **Ask when uncertain** - Request clarification instead of guessing
3. **Document findings** - Share what you discovered during research
4. **Cite sources** - Reference specific files or documentation when applicable
